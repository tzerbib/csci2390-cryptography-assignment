# MPC Voting Application  

> *Question 1: How many inputs does it each party provide into
> the MPC computation, i.e. how many 0s and 1s? How many inputs are there total
> over all three parties? How many input secret shares does your implementation

For the MPC voting application to run, every party must participate in the score
of every candidate. Thus, every party provides one input per option (exactly
one 1 for the option it votes for, and one zero per other option).

Thus, across the whole votes of $p$ participants over $o$ options, there are
$p \times o$ inputs that have to be shared with every participants, thus
$p^2 \times o$ secret shares.

If we just look at the secret shares sent by one client, for a fixed option,
over multiple votes, they just look like random numbers.

It is hard to know if Shamir secret share is a threshold secret sharing algorithm
by just looking at the secret shares.

For our secret ballot algorithm to be usable as a voting system, we have
to ensure that every vote is *correct*, and that every user can only vote once.
Supposing that the server relies on an authentication system,
the only once semantic can be achieved alongside with the corectness verification
of the vote (ensuring that each vote is exactly 0 or 1, and that the sum of all
votes of a user is exactly 1).

Remark: by only ensuring that the sum of the votes is exactly one, we end up
with a vote system which allows for users to state preferences among different
options instead of clearly choosing one of them (e.g. option 1:0.2,
option 2: 0.5, option 3: 0.3).


\newpage

The program has now to perform MPC for every vote of every client,
which considerably slows it down.

Lower values of the modulo induce faster computation than larger values.
